                <p>&emsp;Bugquest is a webcomic that was run in the summer of 2022 and has been on an indefinite hiatus since. The comic uses reader commands to dictate the direction of the story, allowing readers to give commands as to what the characters will do akin to a text based adventure game.
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;The project began as a second attempt at a comic of a similar premise titled Mothquest that I ran a few years prior to little success. The unfortuante nature of a comic run by reader commands is that without any readers, there's no action; something that Bugquest managed to get past by being run on discord and done through grabbing people from aggregate communities I was active in at the time.
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;Unfortunately, the comic entered hiatus due to not having as much time to run it with the start of a new semester and starting a new job, very quickly leading to burnout as I attempted to maintain it. As of now, it still sits on hiatus as a project I intend to return to once I'm able to fit it into my schedule.</p>
                <p>&emsp;If you would like to read it, the comic can be found via the link below.</p>
