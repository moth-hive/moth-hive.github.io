                <p>&emsp;Back in 2022, I was surveying the internet for roleplay and tabletop communities to try and make some stories and get through some bad writer's block. The resulting place was a post-apocalyptic city that was overtaken by gang warfare and slime, the players being the gangsters.
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;Climbin' out of the Sauce is the result of me taking the mascot I was using at the time and drawing an explanation for how she ended up in the world in the first place. In the setting, there is an eldritch variation of slime called negaslime that is related to the afterlife and collects in the sewers. This moth was the result of hundreds if not thousands of dead and crushed bugs washing down the sewers in antislime and sparking enough will to coalesce it into its own new being, as seen above. She is quite literally, climbing out of the sauce.
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;Little did I know at the time, but this sparked an entirely new project that would occupy my mind even now as I write this. As an exercise in breaking through art block, this was beyond successful.
