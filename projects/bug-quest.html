			Bug Quest is a webcomic I started in May 2022 as a side project to practice art and finally step into the webcomic scene. It follows the format of old forum quests from the 2000s, which itself was inspired by old text based adventure games from the 90s. As a result, the comic doubles as an interactive game as well as a performative piece as readers make commands for the characters to follow and I interpret them to direct the story. The format itself was made largely popular from the webcomic Homestuck and while I can't deny its influence here, I've tried to diferentiate it in several ways.<br>
        </p>

            The format itself is fairly niche but the community is active as can be seen by other the comics that are on the site I host Bug Quest on. By now it's turned into an active grounds for experimenting with art, character design, and occasionally animation. If you would like to read it, there are links at the bottom of the page as well as a link to the discord server that I use to take commands. Give it a look when you can!
