                <p>&emsp;Hyperspace Moth is an exercise in glitch art using an image I <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/kipine/art/moth-775597914" target="_blank" title="Credit to Kipine on Deviantart">sourced from the web</a> and used an AI tool called deep dream to distort for one step and ran through several audio filters for the second.
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;While I haven't used deep dream since then, the utility and novelty of the tool was fairly interesting when I did use it. Rather than attempt to completely create new images based on a training set, it would allow one to input an image or a video and provide another as a source to pull from. The results that I had seen were videos of frogs distorted through an image of nonsense that would make it constantly transform and shift from a bus to a mass of eyes and so on. Freaky, gross to look at, and eldritch in nature. I was in love.</p>
                <p>&emsp;Of course, being able to use any image as source material for the digital equivalent of recreation via collage means that you can use more than an i-spy page as a source. Hence, the second image in the set, recreating the source image through a galaxy wallpaper sourced from google images (sadly lost from my computer making it near impossible to find the source.)
                </p>
                <p>&emsp;The name "Hyperspace Moth" stems from what I believed the image to look like once I took it out of the image shredder that was the reverb filter on audacity. It reminded me of special effects in sci-fi movies of people entering hyper space or faster than light travel, going so fast that the people turn into smear frames on the screen and stare into a light show. My one complaint is the lack of documentation on the filters used, preventing me from ever being able to recreate the effect on other images.
